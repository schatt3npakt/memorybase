# Memorybase

Memorybase is a Vue3 project. It's a memory game wherein players select a memory theme and then find pairs of two to win.

There are two types of memory supported:
- **Normal memory games**, where players find pairs of identical cards
- **Associative memory**, where players find unique cards that share some kind of connection.

The memory games are configured inside of /src/data. Games that do not have an associated pairs.json are automatically normal memory games.

## Demo
